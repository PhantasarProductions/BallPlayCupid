# BallPlay Cupid

This repository will contain the script files for an experimental game called "BallPlay Cupid".

This game will be entirely scripted in 100% Lua code, and it's set up for the [Love2D](http://love2d.org) engine. I need to note though, that just zipping these scripts into a .love file and starting the Love2D engine with it will get you nowhere for 2 reasons.

a. The assets will NOT be posted in this repository
b. In order to set up a quick way to import my "libraries" which I intend to use for future Love projects as well, I set up a little pre-processor. If you just zip everything without using that preprocessor first,all that Love2D will do is produce a black blank window. This builder and the needed libraries (which you will also not find in this repository) are vital to get stuff on the move.
