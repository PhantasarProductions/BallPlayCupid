Developed by: Jeroen Petrus Broks (Phantasar Productions)

The game itself has been licensed under the terms of the General Public License.

One exception clause, however. The GNU allows modification and the distribution of modified versions, however in order to keep the on-line charts fair, modified versions may NOT be used for the network features the game offers, unless Jeroen Petrus Broks officially approved the modifications and made them "official".

Below is a list of contributors to the game. This list was last updated on Tue 29 March 2016; 19:42:12.

This list is automatically updated every time I modify the game myself, and as soon as I push my changes, an updated version of this list is sent as well.
