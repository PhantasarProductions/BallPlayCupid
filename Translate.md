# Translation notes


### Note!
At the present time, the original English text is still incomplete. Beginning to translate now will not really help. Until the English language file is complete, all sent in translation file will be denied.



## If you are interested in translating the game please act this way:

- Download the original English language file: https://github.com/Tricky1975/BallPlayCupid/blob/master/Script/languages/English.lua
- Change all strings values into the translations in your language.
- If your language has characters not supported by the standard Love Font, pick a FREE font that does support this and place a comment in the language file telling me were to obtain this font
- If you can name the file to the name of your language in your language by only using roman letters (Like SVENSKA or DEUTSCH) do so. If your language uses letters not part of this alphabet (like Russian, Greek, Chinese, etc), then name the file with the English name.
- Once you're done, go to GitHub, and fork the BallPlay Cupid project
- Now send in the file onto your branch in the correct folder
- And do a pull request.


## Before you translate, keep a few things in mind.

- Don't send in a translation for a language already covered. I will not accept it.
- I don't mind pull requests with spelling corrections, however don't claim credit for the translation as a whole, because if I see the name of the translator change I will reject the pull request, unless you have a very good story.


## What to do if you think a translaton is fake?

I only speak English and Dutch good enough to set up the files for (don't bother coming up with a Dutch translation, as I'll provide it myself). I can speak a little German and French, and that's in.
All I can do to have a tiny bit of control is Google Translate, but we all know how reliable that stuff is. If you think a translation is fake, just write me an issue in the issue tracker. If I can confirm your claim I will just remove the translation, and also make a note to myself not to accept translation from that person ever again. ;)


## One more note!

The selected language only affects the game interface and only while logged in. 
Text inside the levels will always remain in English regarless of the chosen language.
